## General Information
- Background: Identify the factors which can contributes in bike sharing prediction
- Business Problem: Analyse all the given feature and find out which ones are affecting the bike sharing count 
- Dataset: Bike sharing data of 2 years, having numerical and categorical independent variables 

<!-- You don't have to answer all the questions - just the ones relevant to your project. -->

## Conclusions
- The built model is having 80% of R-squared value
- The residuals are following the normally distributed with a mean 0. 
- Bestfit line equation: 𝑐𝑛𝑡=0.1907+0.2296∗𝑦𝑟+0.0526∗𝑤𝑜𝑟𝑘𝑖𝑛𝑔𝑑𝑎𝑦+0.5684∗𝑡𝑒𝑚𝑝−0.1643∗ℎ𝑢𝑚−0.1943∗𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑑𝑠𝑝𝑒𝑒𝑑+0.0629∗𝑆𝑎𝑡−0.0401∗𝐽𝑎𝑛−0.0429∗𝐽𝑢𝑙+0.0909∗𝑆𝑒𝑝+0.0765∗𝑠𝑢𝑚𝑚𝑒𝑟+0.1251∗𝑤𝑖𝑛𝑡𝑒𝑟−0.2425∗𝐿𝑖𝑔ℎ𝑡𝑠𝑛𝑜𝑤−0.0538∗𝑀𝑖𝑠𝑡
